# usbloadergx
This is NOT the official USB Loader GX. This is a tweaked version of the One on https://github.com/wiidev/usbloadergx/tree/enhanced
The main Purpose of this version is to add two more options to the custom servers The options are BenFi WFC and AltWFC, this is meant 
to provide an easier experience for users who would like to connect to those services either because they were banned from Wiimmfi or Just dislike it

Update: Due to issues with source code compilation I have decided I cannot complete this project mainly due to it only being compatible with one specific version of portlibs (that probably only exist on Cyan's computer tbh) however if anyone would like to help fishish it by fixing the parts that are broken/incompatible so it can be compiled 

I only ask that you try above all to keep in the extra servers for AltWFC and BenFi
